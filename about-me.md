**About Me:**  
I’m a multimedia student passionate about technology, design, and creativity.  
I enjoy learning how visuals, motion graphics, and web technologies come together to create engaging digital experiences.

**What I Learned:**  
Git helps manage different versions of a project, track changes, and collaborate with others easily.  

**Real-world Example:**  
When I upload or update my website or design project on GitHub, Git keeps track of every change I make — like saving my work with a timeline. This helps me work safely and efficiently without losing any progress.
